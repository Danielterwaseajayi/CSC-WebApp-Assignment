Division of Work Between Team Members

 Solomon — Flask Setup & WiFi Backend Logic

Solomon was responsible for the foundational setup of the Flask web application. He initialized the project environment, structured the application routes, and implemented the backend logic to extract saved WiFi passwords from the user’s system using system-level commands. His role ensured the app could interface with the operating system securely and efficiently to retrieve relevant network data.

 Daniel — WiFi Form & Password Retrieval Functionality

Daniel implemented the form that allows users to input the WiFi SSID (network name). He also developed the logic that processes user submissions and connects them to the password retrieval function. His work ensured that user inputs were properly handled and the appropriate password — or an error message — was displayed in response.

 Demetris — Error Handling & Result Display Integration

Demetris took charge of error management and user feedback integration. He ensured that if a WiFi name was not found or an error occurred during password extraction, the user would receive a clear and user-friendly message. He also contributed to dynamically rendering results using Flask's templating system (Jinja2), enhancing the interactivity of the app.

 Luther — HTML Template Design & Dynamic Content Display

Luther created and structured the HTML template for the application. His focus was on clean layout design and integration of dynamic content placeholders. The template was built to display the SSID, password, or errors with clarity and precision, improving the app's usability and clarity for end-users.

 Cornelius — CSS Styling & User Interface Design

Cornelius styled the frontend of the application using CSS. He crafted the visual theme, including a modern dark gradient, responsive form elements, styled buttons, and a visually engaging result display box. His work ensured that the app not only worked effectively but also looked professional and user-friendly across devices.
